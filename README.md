This is a classic game of feeding the snake in an app-like form, i.e., designed using JavaScript. Here the user has to grab the block by the use of arrow keys. When the user's block grabs the other block, the snake's size (no. of blocks) increases. If the snake touches the walls of the board, the user loses the game. The user can play the game as many times as he wants and can set a high score.

Components Used : HTML, CSS, JavaScript
